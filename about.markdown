## Me in 10 Minutes

While I recognize that growth and experience might reshape my perspectives, here's a snapshot of who I am as of December 27, 2023:

### I'm obsessively focused on coding

Over my voluntary leave of absence from Princeton, I realized that I love coding and the better I get at it, the more I love it. This can be anything from API design, picking apart the internals of how a DB works, creating a full-stack web app for users, or making an ML model that detects my friends' faces. The more I master this craft, the more joy I get from my work.

I used to be obsessively focused on content creation with a TikTok profile of 150k+ followers and my attempts at growing a YouTube channel. Multiple incentives got me to change direction and put all my eggs in the programming basket:

- I don't like half-assing career goals by setting more than one at a time
- I liked programming more than content creation
- I enjoy solitude more than the spotlight

### I prefer waking up early

The early morning hours are perfect working hours for me. I've tested the late night coding sessions romanticized in _The Social Network_ and other tropes, but they don't work for me unless I have a deadline. I get exhausted after an evening dinner, and I tend to work better when my body is fasted. I prefer the consistent regiment of waking up at 5:00 AM on the weekdays, making a cup of coffee, and getting to work.

### I love EDM

Ever since I stumbled across the fellow Swede Avicci in middle school, I've loved electronic dance music (EDM). I especially like the anxiety-inducing, fast-paced, heavy beat drop EDM. I'm not sure if this is a reflection of my personality or if the music itself impacts my personality, but I assume it's a mix of both.
