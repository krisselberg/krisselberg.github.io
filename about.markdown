## Me in 10 Minutes

While I recognize that growth and experience might reshape my perspectives, here's a snapshot of who I am as of March 19, 2024:

### I'm obsessively focused on creating

I used to be obsessively focused on content creation with a TikTok profile of 150k+ followers and attempts at growing a YouTube channel.

Over my voluntary leave of absence from Princeton, I realized that I love coding and the better I get at it, the more I love it. This can be anything from API design, picking apart the internals of how a DB works, creating a full-stack web app for users, or making an ML model that detects my friends' faces. The more I master this craft of creating, the more joy I get from my work.

I currently combine programming with content creation by writing technical blog posts for Emerge Tools picking apart mobile app architectures and improvements, aiming for top posts on HackerNews.

### I prefer waking up early

The early morning hours are perfect working hours for me. I've tested the late night coding sessions romanticized in _The Social Network_ and other tropes, but they don't work for me unless I have a deadline. I get exhausted after an evening dinner, and I tend to work better when my body is fasted. I prefer the consistent regiment of waking up at 5:00 AM on the weekdays, making a cup of coffee, and getting to work.

### I love EDM

Ever since I stumbled across the fellow Swede Avicci in middle school, I've loved electronic dance music (EDM). I especially like the anxiety-inducing, fast-paced, heavy beat drop EDM. I'm not sure if this is a reflection of my personality or if the music itself impacts my personality, but I assume it's a mix of both.

### I love learning through reading

For the past 3 years, I read mostly non-fiction books (biographies, science, self-help) to try and improve. Recently, I've been reading more Tolstoy and Dostoevsky through classes at Princeton. Literature has been surprisingly helpful in recognizing my flaws in the characters.
